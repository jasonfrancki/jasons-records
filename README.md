# Purpose

This app was built to help keep track of my growing record collection. The idea came about after I purchased an album that I forgot I already had in my collection - now when I see a record on sale that I'm interested in, I can quickly browse or search the app if needed to see if I already have it. I also added a 'random' option to pick a random album when I'm having trouble deciding what I want to listen to at the moment.

# Technology Used

The app uses React and fetches the data from an API built from Sanity CMS.
